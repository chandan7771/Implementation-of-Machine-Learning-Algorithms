# Implementation-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
1.In this repository machine learning algorithms like Linear regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and K-nearest are implemented on different-different datasets using jupyter notebbok and python libraries.

2.A problem statement is provided and according to that we have to implement machine learning algorithms to build best possible model.

# 1.Problem statement for Linear Regression 

The data (given below) contains the selling prices of different houses based on different characteristics/attributes like area, no. of rooms, no. of bathrooms, etc.

At times, the property dealers appreciate the prices based on the demand and hence there is rise in prices in real estate. So, in order to cope with this problem so that it is beneficial for the customers, we must have a model in place which should tell us the ideal prices of the house based on its characteristics.

The objective of the study is to predict the ideal prices of the houses based on their characteristics using a regression algorithm.

# 2.Problem statement for Logistic Regression

The dataset contains the information like personal information of the customer, transaction information, and bank information belonging to a bank. It is often necessary to predict when the customers are going to withdraw their money from the bank account and stay dormant. Being able to predict this, the bank can take necessary action to prevent customers from withdrawing huge sums and stay an active/loyal customer. Our task is to be able to predict the customers who are going to churn based on the information given.

# 3.Problem statement for Decision Trees

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all kinds of home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban, and rural areas. Customer first applies for a home loan and after that company validates the customer eligibility for the loan.

The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling an online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others. To automate this process, they have provided a dataset to identify the customer segments that are eligible for loan amounts so that they can specifically target these customers.

# 4.Problem statement for Random Forest

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all kinds of home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban, and rural areas. Customer first applies for a home loan and after that company validates the customer eligibility for the loan.

This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. Some ideas for exploration:

How does the probability of default payment vary by categories of different demographic variables?
Which variables are the strongest predictors of default payment?

# 5.Problem statement for K-means

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all kinds of home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban, and rural areas. Customer first applies for a home loan and after that company validates the customer eligibility for the loan.

A marketing firm wants to launch a promotional campaign in different regions of the country. So, in order to do that, they need to understand which areas they should focus their resources in order to cover the entire region. We are provided with the population data based on different locations along with the demographics. The objective is to segregate the regions into different groups so that the marketing team can plan their resources accordingly. So, we have to apply classification techniques in order to segregate the regions into different clusters which will help the marketing team.
