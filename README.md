# Implementation-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
 In this repository machine learning algorithms like Linear regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and K-nearest are implemented on different-different datasets using jupyter notebbok and python libraries.
 A problem statement is provided and according to that we have to implement machine learning algorithm to build best possible model
